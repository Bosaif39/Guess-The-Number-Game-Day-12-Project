### **Guess The Number Game**

**Overview:**

This is the Day 12 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. In this game, players guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player continues guessing until they either find the correct number or exhaust their number of attempts.

**How It Works:**

1. **Guess the Number:** Players guess a number within the specified range (1 to 100).
2. **Receive Feedback:** The game informs players if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
3. **Continue Guessing:** Players continue guessing until they find the correct number or run out of attempts.
